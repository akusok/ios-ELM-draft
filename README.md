Old but working version on an iOS ELM with GPU acceleration.

You would need an actual iPhone to run it, not a simulator.  
Try running an app on a phone - it will fail. Then drag files from `data...` folder into the app on the phone, and run it again.

Uses two packages that are from somewhere online. Maybe modified. Find them by name if interested in their source.  
Ideally you should get new versions of these for code development from their sources.
